# Contributing
If you are willing to contribute to the project, make sure you have the appropriate tools first.

In case you are not a coder, it's likely better to create an issue, describing what you want to be implemented. Or well, you could learn programming too.

Unfortunately it's impossible to globally ignore config files in git, so you will have to manually avoid pushing them, or run the following command against them.

FYI, it's done with `git update-index --assume-unchanged [FILES]`

If you've managed this, have fun coding!!!
